## Abstract

```
In this paper, we propose Cast-A-Plot, a movie cast rec-
ommendation system that predicts suitable actors for
movies based on movie plots and genres. We leverage
BERT pre-trained models to obtain actor and plot embed-
ding and use clustering and ranking techniques to rec-
ommend a list of actors. The proposed method demon-
strates high accuracy in suggesting appropriate actors
for movies with varying ratings.

## 1 Introduction

```
Recommendation systems have become an increasingly
important part of many industries, including the movie
industry. Casting decisions are critical to the success
of a movie, and traditionally, these decisions have been
based on the intuition and experience of casting direc-
tors and producers. However, with recent advancements
in natural language processing and machine learning, it
is now possible to develop data-driven approaches for
recommending suitable actors for movies.
In this paper, we introduce Cast-A-Plot, a movie cast
recommendation system that utilizes BERT embedding
and K-Means Clustering techniques. Our approach lever-
ages information on the movie‚Äôs plot and genres to sug-
gest relevant actors for a given movie. We used differ-
ent approaches to develop our recommendation system,
ranging from basic methods such as using word embed-
ding model such as Glove and cosine similarity to more
advanced techniques that involved fine-tuning the BERT
1 pre-trained models and using clustering, BERT model,

and embedding to recommend actors. We also explored
using multi-label classification, although this approach
falls outside the scope of traditional recommendation
systems techniques.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our Cast-A-Plot sys-
tem, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation using
a diverse dataset that included information on various
attributes of movies, such as their titles, genres, plots,
and IMDb ratings. This evaluation enabled us to assess
the accuracy and relevance of the recommended actors
and determine the overall performance of Cast-A-Plot.
We used different metrics, including ratios of good and
bad predictions and a score, all of which we defined in
the Evaluation section.
Overall, Cast-A-Plot has the potential to revolution-
ize the casting process in the movie industry by pro-
viding a more data-driven approach to actor selection.
By leveraging machine learning and natural language
processing, we can provide personalized and effective
recommendations for movie casting that are more likely
to result in successful movies. In the following sections,
we will discuss our approach in detail and present our
findings.

## 2 Dataset Creation

In order to develop an effective movie cast recommen-
dation system, the CAST-A-PLOT project required a
diverse range of high-quality datasets for testing and
experimentation. To this end, we obtained four datasets.
Our first dataset, DATASET-1, was obtained directly
from IMDb and contained information on every movie
released after the 1960s. While this dataset provided
extensive coverage, fetching it through the IMDb API
was a slow process that took several days to complete.
To overcome this issue, we created a temporary dataset,
DATASET-2, consisting of recent movies released be-
tween 2018-2020, which enabled us to test various ap-
proaches and hypotheses.
To create our final optimal dataset, we compiled infor-
mation on the top 88 actors of the 21st century and all
their movies, resulting in a well-balanced and optimal-
sized dataset consisting of approximately 2000 movies,
known as DATASET-3. However, obtaining this infor-
mation was not straightforward as the IMDb API did
not provide an option to fetch all the movies given an
actor‚Äôs name. Therefore, we used web scraping to obtain
the names of all the movies that these actors had worked
in, and then used the API to retrieve the other details of
the movies.
We also obtained a dataset from Kaggle, referred to as
DATASET-4, which consisted of around 5000 movies and
was originally designed for a movie recommendation
system. However, this dataset did not include the plot

```
of the movies, so we had to retrieve this information by
using the list of movie names provided in the dataset.
Overall, the creation of these datasets required a sig-
nificant amount of effort and attention to detail to ensure
that we had a diverse and high-quality set of data to eval-
uate the effectiveness of the CastAPlot system.It should
be noted that the results presented in this paper were
obtained from DATASET-3.
```
```
Note:We are recommending one actor, specifically
the protagonist for each datapoint in the dataset. There-
fore, each data point in the dataset contains only main
actor as their caste.
```
## 3 Pre-Processing

```
The pre-processing of DATASET-3 was relatively straight-
forward due to its carefully designed, well-balanced, and
optimal size. We checked the dataset for null and dupli-
cate values in the columns title, plot, actor, and genres.
We found a few null values, which we chose to drop
since they were minimal and would not significantly
affect the system‚Äôs performance.
We also noticed that the actor column contained ac-
tor names of varying lengths, including those with two
words (first name and last name), three words (first
name, middle name, and last name), or even longer. To
ensure consistency in the actor names and facilitate find-
ing the actor embedding from the BERT hidden layers,
we concatenated the words in the name to form a single
string for each actor.
Finally, we conducted an analysis using Kmeans clus-
tering on the actor embedding distribution and found
that Bruce Willis and Robert Duvall were outliers. As a
result, we decided to drop all the data entries containing
these actors. Overall, these pre-processing steps helped
to refine and clean the dataset, enabling us to conduct ro-
bust and accurate analyses and evaluations of our CastA
Plot system.
```
## 4 Approach

```
The approach to the Cast A Plot system can be divided
into two main sections. In the first section, we generate
high-level contextual embeddings for the actor names
and movie plots. As plot, genres, and actors are not nu-
meric data, we cannot use them directly to find similarity
between them. Thus, we find the embedding of the actor
name to recognize similar actors and the embedding of
the plot of the movie to recognize similar plots.
In the second section, we use the similarities gener-
ated in the first section to find the top actor recommen-
dations. Specifically, we find similar movies and actors
and rank them using clustering and rating techniques.
This approach allows us to streamline our analysis and
```

```
Figure 2.Approach Overview
```
evaluations and ensure that we are providing the most
relevant and accurate recommendations for the protag-
onist role in each movie. In the following sections, we
will discuss the two approaches we have used in more
detail.

4.1 Approach-

Our first approach to the CastAplot recommendation
system is a modified version of the basic approach of
finding the numeric embedding of the description of the
datapoint and then finding similarity between them and
ranking them based on the similarity score. Here are the
steps we followed in our Approach-1:

- We use the plot and genres of each data point as
    the description of the datapoint.
- To use Glove Word embedding, we need to pre-
    process the plots by removing stop words, punctu-
    ations, converting to lowercase, and lemmatizing.
- Using the Glove Word Embeddings, we get the
    embedding for each token in the tokenized plot,
    and then average out all the token embeddings to
    get the final embedding of the plot.
- We one-hot-encode the genres to take care of
    them, as there are only a few unique genres.
- Using cosine similarity, we find the plot similar-
    ity score and genre similarity score of the given
    datapoint with all the datapoints in the dataset.
- For the given data point, we use the combined
    similarity score (CSS), which is
       ùê∂ùëÜùëÜ= 0. 75 ‚àóùëùùëôùëúùë°ùëÜùëñùëöùëô+ 0. 25 ‚àóùëîùëíùëõùëüùëíùëÜùëñùëöùëô
    with all the movies in the dataset. This gives us
    the top ten similar movies to the given data point.
- We recommend the ten actors of these top ten
    movies based on the combined similarity score,
    following the same ranking approach.

Overall, this approach involves preprocessing the plot,
finding the Glove Word Embedding, and using cosine
similarity to find the similarity score of the given dat-
apoint with all the datapoints in the dataset. Then, we
use the combined similarity score to recommend similar

```
movies and actors. In the following sections, we will
discuss the results of this approach.
```
```
4.2 Performance and Analysis
Our Approach-1 for the Cast-A-Plot recommendation
system involved generating embeddings for the plot and
genres of each movie to find similar movies and actors.
However, we faced several challenges in achieving sat-
isfactory results with this approach. Here are the issues
we encountered and the steps we took to address them:
```
- Embedding Generation:We used Glove Word
    Embedding to generate embeddings for the plot
    and genres, but this resulted in contextless embed-
    dings that did not take into account the context
    of the words in the plot. This led to poor per-
    formance in recommending actors for random
    movies whose prequel was not present in the
    dataset.
- Length of Plot:Different plots have different
    lengths, which resulted in high variance and made
    it difficult to effectively use the mean of the em-
    beddings.
- Rating of the Actor:We tried incorporating the
    IMDb rating of the movie and the rating of the
    actor as a third parameter, but this did not improve
    the performance of the recommendation system.
- Neural Network:We attempted to train a neu-
    ral network to learn the optimal weights of plot
    similarity and genre similarity, but this did not
    significantly improve the system‚Äôs performance.
Despite these attempts to improve the performance
of Approach-1, we found that it was not satisfactory
for recommending actors for random movies. However,
the approach worked well for recommending actors
for sequels of movies already present in the dataset, as
the plot of both movies would have similar words and
context.
For example, Approach-1 recommended Chris Hemsworth
for the movie Thor: Love and Thunder, as the plot of
the movie is a continuation of the story from Thor: The
Ragnarok, which is present in our dataset. However, for
movies with no prequel in the dataset, such as Once
Upon A Time in Hollywood, the approach did not rec-
ommend top actors such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad
Pitt.
Overall, the main issue with Approach-1 was the con-
textless embeddings generated using Glove Word Em-
bedding. This led to poor performance in recommending
actors for random movies, as the embeddings did not
capture the context of the words in the plot. In the fol-
lowing section, we will discuss our second approach,
which addressed these issues and led to better results in
recommending actors for random movies.

4.3 Approach-

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Trans-
formers) is a transformer-based machine learning model
developed by Google that is designed to generate high-
quality contextualized word embeddings. Using BERT
we will first find the Actor Embedding.

4.3.1 Actor Embedding.

- Actors Genres Dataset (Input):The input to
    the BERT model is a dataset containing the ac-
    tors‚Äô names and the genres they have worked in.
    Each datapoint is represented as a sentence that in-
    cludes the actor‚Äôs name and the genres separated
    by commas. For example, "Leonardo DiCaprio in
    genres drama, romance, tragedy".
- BERT Model (Fine-tuned on Input):In this
    step, the BERT model is fine-tuned on the in-
    put dataset. The model learns to assign attention
    scores to each genre based on the actor‚Äôs experi-
    ence in those genres. This is done using the atten-
    tion mechanisms in the transformers of the BERT
    model, which focus on specific words or phrases
    in a sequence.
- Attention Scores:The attention scores are cal-
    culated by comparing each word in the sequence
    to all the other words and assigning a score based
    on their similarity. Higher attention scores are
    given to words that are more relevant to the ac-
    tor‚Äôs experience in the genres, while lower scores
    are given to less relevant words.
- Actor Embeddings (Output):The actor embed-
    dings are extracted from the hidden layers of the
    fine-tuned BERT model. These embeddings cap-
    ture the actor‚Äôs strengths and characteristics based
    on the attention scores assigned to the genres they

```
have worked in. The resulting embeddings can be
used to recommend actors for specific roles in the
CastAplot recommendation system.
```
```
Figure 4.Actor Embedding Learning - BERT
```
```
The inner workings of the BERT model involve a
multi-layer transformer architecture that processes the
input data in parallel, rather than sequentially. Dur-
ing fine-tuning, the model learns to generate attention
scores for each word in the input sentence. These atten-
tion scores are used to weight the importance of each
word in the sentence, allowing the model to focus on the
most relevant words (i.e., the genres) when generating
the actor embeddings.
This approach is novel and great because it leverages
the power of BERT‚Äôs attention mechanisms to focus on
the actor‚Äôs experience in specific genres. By fine-tuning
the model on a dataset of actors and their associated
genres, the model learns to generate embeddings that
are primarily driven by the genres. This approach differs
from traditional methods that rely on basic similarity
metrics or collaborative filtering. This approach has the
potential to revolutionize the way actors are recom-
mended for roles in movies and other productions.
4.3.2 Plot Embedding.
```
- We use the DistilBERT model from the transform-
    ers library to generate embeddings for the plot of
    each movie. The process involves several steps:
- We import the DistilBERT model and tokenizer
    from the transformers library and specify the pre-
    trained weights to use.
- We retrieve the plot data from the dataset and to-
    kenize it using the BERT tokenizer. Tokenization
    involves breaking down the plot text into indi-
    vidual words or subwords and mapping them to
    unique integer IDs.
- We apply padding to the tokenized inputs to en-
    sure that all sequences are of the same length. The
    padding function adds zeros to the end of shorter
    sequences to match the length of the longest se-
    quence.


CAST-A-PLOT: Cast Recommendation System Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

- We create a mask to indicate which tokens are
    actual text and which are padding. The mask is
    used to exclude padding tokens from the attention
    mechanism in the BERT model.
- We pass the tokenized and padded inputs and the
    mask through the DistilBERT model to get the
    final hidden states. We extract the embeddings for
    each plot by taking the first token embedding for
    each sequence.

```
Figure 5.Plot Embedding Learning - BERT
```
The resulting plot embeddings are high-quality and in-
formative because they capture the context of the words
in the plot text. BERT is a transformer-based model
that is designed to generate high-quality contextualized
word embeddings by considering the surrounding words
in a sentence or sequence. This allows it to capture the
meaning and context of words more effectively than
traditional methods like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
Compared to the plot embeddings obtained in the first
approach, which used a simple averaging method, the
BERT embeddings are more informative and impactful.
The BERT embeddings capture the context and meaning
of the words in the plot text, which allows them to better
represent the overall plot of the movie. This makes them
more effective for recommending similar movies based
on plot similarities.

4.3.3 Ranking Actors.In our CastAplot recommen-
dation system, we use two ranking mechanisms to rank
the top 10 actors based on their suitability for specific
roles. These mechanisms are the Average Actor Rating
and the clustering of actor embeddings. Here are the
details of each mechanism:

```
1.Average Actor Rating:This mechanism involves
calculating the average rating of all the movies in
the dataset in which the actor had worked. This
gives us an overall high-level knowledge of how
well the actor can perform when selected for a
particular task. The actors with higher average
```
```
ratings are considered to be more suitable for spe-
cific roles. To calculate the Average Actor Rating,
we first retrieve the ratings data from the dataset
and filter it to only include movies in which the
actor had worked. We then calculate the average
rating for each actor and use this value to rank
the actors.
2.Clustering of Actor Embeddings:This mech-
anism involves clustering the actor embeddings
based on their similarity. We use unsupervised
learning techniques like K-means clustering to
group the actors based on their embeddings. The
actors belonging to the cluster with the maxi-
mum frequency in the top 10 are placed at the top,
and the actors with lower frequency clusters are
placed lower. To cluster the actor embeddings, we
first generate the embeddings for each actor using
the BERT model. We then use K-means clustering
to group the actors based on their embeddings.
Once the clusters are formed, we count the num-
ber of actors in each cluster that are in the top 10
and place the actors in descending order based on
the frequency of their clusters.
Both of these ranking mechanisms are useful in deter-
mining the suitability of actors for specific roles. The Av-
erage Actor Rating provides a high-level overview of the
actor‚Äôs performance in previous roles, and the clustering
of actor embeddings provides a more fine-grained anal-
ysis of the actor‚Äôs strengths and characteristics based
on the movies they have worked in. By combining the
Average Actor Rating and the clustering of actor embed-
dings, we can generate more informative and impactful
recommendations for the CastAplot recommendation
system.
```
```
4.3.4 Final Implementation.The final implemen-
tation of CastAplot recommendation system involves
several steps:
```
- Pre-processing the data - This involves cleaning
    and formatting the movie dataset to obtain the
    necessary information for the recommendation
    system.
- Fine-tuning BERT - We fine-tune the BERT model
    to generate highly contextualized actor embed-
    dings based on the genres and characteristics of
    the actor. This allows us to capture the unique fea-
    tures and strengths of each actor to recommend
    them for specific roles.
- Finding contextual plot embeddings - We use the
    BERT model to generate contextualized embed-
    dings for the plot of each movie. These embed-
    dings capture the meaning and context of the
    words in the plot text, allowing us to find sim-
    ilar movies based on plot similarities.


Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA Rakshit Bang, Rahul Jain, and Anurag Singh Naruka

- Finding the top 10 similar movies - Based on the
    contextual plot embeddings, we use cosine similar-
    ity to find the top 10 movies that are most similar
    to the input movie.
- Finding the top 10 actors - From the top 10 similar
    movies, we extract the top 10 actors who have
    worked in those movies. These actors are consid-
    ered to be suitable for the input movie based on
    their performance in similar movies.
- Ranking the actors - We rank the top 10 actors
    using a two-step mechanism. First, we cluster the
    actors based on their embeddings using unsuper-
    vised learning techniques like K-means clustering.
    Second, we rank the actors within each cluster
    based on their Average Actor Rating, which is the
    average rating of all the movies in the dataset in
    which the actor had worked.
- Final recommendations - We obtain the final top
    10 actor recommendations for the input movie
    based on the rankings generated in step 6.

4.3.5 Performance and Analysis.The evaluation
metric for the CastAplot project is designed to measure
the effectiveness of the recommendation system in rec-
ommending actors for specific roles based on the success
of the movies they have worked in. The metric is based
on the IMDb movie rating, which is a widely recognized
measure of a movie‚Äôs popularity and critical acclaim.
The evaluation metric distinguishes between success-
ful and unsuccessful movies based on their IMDb rating.
For successful movies with IMDb rating greater than
7.0, the recommendation system is expected to recom-
mend the same actor for the role, as their performance
in the movie was considered to be good. Similarly, for
unsuccessful movies with IMDb rating less than 4.0, the
recommendation system is not expected to recommend
the same actor, as their performance in the movie was
considered to be poor.
To measure the effectiveness of the recommendation
system, two ratios are defined: the Good Prediction Ra-
tio (GP) and the Bad Prediction Ratio (BP). The GP is
calculated as the ratio of the total number of movies
with IMDb rating greater than 7.0 and the original actor
in the top 10 recommended actors, to the total number
of movies with IMDb rating greater than 7.0. The BP
is calculated as the ratio of the total number of movies
with IMDb rating less than 4.0 and the original actor
in the top 10 recommended actors, to the total number
of movies with IMDb rating less than 4.0. We get the
following results on the DATASET-3 using approach 2:
A good recommendation system is expected to have
a high GP and a low BP. This means that the system is
able to recommend the same actor for successful movies,

```
Figure 6.Good Prediction Ratio : Approach-
```
```
Figure 7.Bad Prediction Ratio : Approach-
```
```
while avoiding recommending the same actor for un-
successful movies. By using this evaluation metric, the
CastAplot project can measure the effectiveness of the
recommendation system in generating informative and
impactful recommendations for actors based on their
performance in similar movies. The system build using
approach 2 on the DATASET-3 gaveGP = 0.8165and
BP = 0.1904. As we can see from the results, our system
shows excellent performance!
Below are the actor recommendations for some famous
movies:
```
```
Figure 8.Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League: Recommended
Actors
```
```
We have Ben Affleck for Zack Synders‚Äôs Justice League.
Infact, we consider the recommendation for the Zack
Synders‚Äôs Justice League, we can see Dwayne Johnson,
Chris Hemmsworth, Robert Downey Jr., Kevin Spacey
this all are very highly suitable for the role. Dwayne
Johnson is known for his muscular physique and action-
oriented roles, which may make him a suitable choice
for an action movie or superhero film. Similarly, Chris
Hemsworth has played the role of Thor in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe, demonstrating his ability to handle
superhero roles. Robert Downey Jr. has also played a
superhero role as Iron Man, and has a wide range of
acting experience that could make him a strong choice
for such types of role. Kevin Spacey has a long history
of acclaimed performances in film and television, and
could bring a level of gravitas and skill to such role. Thus,
it shows our system is successfully taking in the context
and characteristics of the movie and its character.
The movie "Zeros and Ones" has a low IMDB rating
of 3.3 and does not have any famous actors with genres
such as action, thriller, or war. This suggests that the
```

CAST-A-PLOT: Cast Recommendation System Conference‚Äô17, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA

```
Figure 9.Zeros and Ones: Recommended Actors
```
movie was not successful and that the actor was not
well-suited for their role. As expected, the original actor
of this movie is not included in the recommended list
of actors by the Cast-A-Plot system. The recommended
actors by the system are known for their ability to handle
the challenges of action, thriller, and war movies and
have built up a strong reputation with audiences and
critics alike. Their experience and versatility make them
ideal choices for movies in these genres.
The Cast-A-Plot system has recommended Brad Pitt
for the movie "Babylon" and Jennifer Lawrence for "The
Hunger Games," both of which are well-suited for their
respective roles. Interestingly, the system has recom-
mended similar actors for both the superhero movie
"Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League" and "The Hunger Games".
Notably, the system has learned that "The Hunger Games"
requires a female lead, and has recommended Jennifer
Lawrence as the best fit for this role. However, the sys-
tem did not recommend any female lead for "Zack Sny-
der‚Äôs Justice League." as the super hero is male in the
movie‚Äôs story-line. This highlights the implicit learn-
ing of key characteristics for roles, such as gender, to
ensure that the system provides the most appropriate
recommendations.

## 5 Future Scope

```
The proposed future scope of the CastAplot project in-
volves several exciting ideas that could significantly en-
hance the recommendation system‚Äôs effectiveness and
accuracy.
Firstly, the project aims to expand the recommenda-
tion system to predict the entire cast of a movie instead
of just the protagonist actor. This will require incorpo-
rating additional data about the other actors and their
performances in similar movies to generate relevant
recommendations for the entire cast.
Secondly, the future scope of the project involves in-
corporating more personal information about the actors
in the fine-tuning sentence, such as their physical build,
sense of humor, voice quality, age, gender, awards, other
hobbies, and experience. This will allow the system to
generate more personalized embeddings of the actor,
which will denote the actor as a whole, not just based
on the genres they have worked in.
Thirdly, the project aims to incorporate the storyline
of the movie and find the characteristic qualities of the
characters to recommend actors who would best suit
these qualities. This will involve finding similarities be-
tween the characters the actor has played in different
movies and the character that needs to be played in the
new movie.
